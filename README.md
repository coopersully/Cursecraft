Cursecraft is a datapack for Minecraft: Java Edition that aims to do one thing: expand the survival experience. This datapack creates a modpack-like experience with minimal installation, a connected storyline, and so much more. Unlike our previous datapacks such as [Vanilla Expansion](https://github.com/coopersully/vanilla-expansion), the goal of this datapack is to completely overhaul the survival experience. Cursecraft adds brand new questlines, items, blocks, mobs, game mechanics, dimensions, and so much more.

## Want an even bigger experience? Try the [Cursecraft Fabric Mod](https://github.com/coopersully/cursecraft-fabric)!
